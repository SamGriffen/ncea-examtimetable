# ncea-examtimetable
An online tool for storing information about your NCEA exams.

Project for (ironically?) an internal. Using GitHub as a way to manage my versions.

Currently I have not uploaded everything to this repository, as I do not need to as of the current moment. The extras are things such as the SQL database.
